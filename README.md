# Flutter-Frontend-Associate-Project
 
## Running the Project
To run this project: please intall the Live Server extention for VSCoder (ritwickdey.LiveServer) or use any tool that will simulate a live server locally.

## Summary
For this project, I chose to just use vanilla HTML/CSS and Javascript because I wanted to just focus on the basics and also use my knowledge from previous classes. I ran into a few issues using the json file so I decided to change it to a js file since in order to debug the errors and run it live, it required me to install a series of packages. While completing this challenge, I did a lot of research and included functions such as insertRow() and insertCell() to create rows and columns for my table without needing to start from scratch and create a table in JS. I also used sort() in order to sort through the albums by the last played timestamp instead of creating my own sorting algorithm to increase efficiency. Additionally, I created my own functions in order to help in the legibility of my code.
